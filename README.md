# Project Structure
1. ```utils.py:``` helper functions; run this file to get additional information about the data
2. ```NNN.py, constants.py:``` parameters and routine for training a NNN
3. ```RNN.py, constants_rnn.py:``` parameters and routine for training an RNN
4. ```models.py:``` all models may be defined here
5. ```process_data.py:``` this code was used to process data; no need to run or change it

To run in a local environment, the paths to the datasets must be change.
Search ```TODO``` inside the code. Python interpreter must be manually setup as well - we recommend Python 3.10.
